                <h2>I am a Student at Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
                <p>I am currently a 5/5 co-op stevens student studying computer engineering. Inside computer engineering I have
                    taken a lot of technical electives concentrated in computer science because im looking to go into software
                    development. I have commuted to Stevens for all my 5 years of being here. I am russian, my parents immigrated from russia but i was born and raised in New York City. I also 
                    enjoy playing video games and hanging out with my friends. I also enjoy taking pictures as I am into photography.
